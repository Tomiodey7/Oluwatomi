       <h2> BIG DREAM </h2>
       <h4> I hope to become a pharmaceutical chemist someday or maybe Chemical Programmer...lol and put to use programming into scientific research. </h4>
       <p> This pandemic lockdown has pushed me forward in achieving this dream. I have learnt phyton programming, I'm learning HTML and CSS with which i can build a simple website. I'm working tirelessly also on building applications particularly in my line of being a chemist to make computational chemistry a much more realistic aspect. </p>
